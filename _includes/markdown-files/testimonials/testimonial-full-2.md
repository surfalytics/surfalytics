<p><i>“Surfalytics SQL course helped refine my skills”</i></p>

It's been almost a month since I started my new job, and I’m really enjoying it. The role involves data processing and storage, which is exactly what I wanted. The salary is great too! But it wasn’t easy—I had to learn a lot before and even more now on the job.
<br><br>
When I joined Surfalytics I barely knew anything about SQL beyond a basic SELECT query. Terms like data warehouse and Kimball were completely foreign to me. But thanks to your clear explanations, I finally understood the big picture—how everything works together in data teams.
<br><br>
Looking back, here’s some advice I’d give to anyone starting out:
<br><br>
1. Decide early whether you want to focus on BI, data engineering, analytics, or data science, and stick with it.
<br>
2. Start applying for jobs as soon as possible. You’ll quickly identify gaps in your knowledge and know where to focus your learning.
<br>
3. Repeat what you learn, or you’ll forget it! I took SQL courses three times in less than a year because I didn’t use it enough at my old job. It only stuck when I started building my own projects.
<br>
4. Create a GitHub repository or Tableau Public portfolio for your projects. This not only helps reinforce your learning but also gives you something to show during interviews and can be useful in your future job.

Thanks again, and good luck to everyone in the community—don’t give up!
