When I moved to Canada, I decided to change careers from risk analytics after 10 years in the field. I applied to 220 data analyst jobs, went through 16 interviews, but kept getting rejections. I even tried returning to risk analytics, but with limited success.
<br><br>
I then set my sights on data engineering, even though it felt like a huge leap. With the support of the data community—especially Dmitry, who guided me on what tools to learn and how to improve my resume—I began to feel more confident. After facing initial rejections, I learned to refine my approach and focus on the key problems interviewers wanted to solve.
<br><br>
Within three months, I applied to 45 jobs, attended 8 interviews, and finally landed an offer. My experience taught me that job searching is a marathon—persistence and support from the right people make all the difference.
