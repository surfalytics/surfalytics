<p><i>“Surfalytics SQL course helped refine my skills”</i></p>

In June 2020, I discovered Surfalytics, and it became a game-changer for me. Early on, I realized the importance of data analytics, and some webinars were incredibly useful. After some time, I landed a job as a systems analyst in retail product development, earning an average starting salary.

With 7 months of experience and self-study (~10 hours a week), I managed to secure a new offer with a salary about 2.5 times higher. Surfalytics SQL course, one of the best out there, helped refine my skills. Networking played a big role too—I wasn’t even planning to change jobs, but the opportunity found me!

For anyone starting out, with SQL, Tableau, or PowerBI, you can land a job quickly. Add Python to that, and jobs will come to you! Never give up, and good luck to everyone!For anyone starting out, with SQL, Tableau, or PowerBI, you can land a job quickly. Add Python to that, and jobs will come to you!
