Module 1.2 The Role of Analytics in an Organization

An organization exists to bring some value (value). There are 3 key groups to whom a particular business might be beneficial:

1. Business owners (shareholders);
2. Employees (employees);
3. Customers (customers).

The most important group is the customers, as many modern companies operate on the principle of "customer obsession".

For a business to grow, it needs to create more value for each of these groups. For customers, for instance, this means enhancing the customer experience. For employees, it involves achieving a balance between work and life and providing a competitive salary (work-life balance, salary). For the owners, it means generating income. 

For successful business growth and for these groups to perform their roles, decision-making is crucial. To make decisions, data is needed. Data can be in its raw form (raw data) or can be in the form of organized information (organized raw data). One of the tasks of a analyst or engineer is to provide data to the groups described above for further decision-making. Therefore, it's very important to understand how exactly the work done by a different kind of data roles impact what happens with the business.
